#write a for loop program to print 4 in string format 4 times.

for i in range(int(a)): #The for loop iterates for 'a' number of times. Here, we manually converted 'a' into integer data type to get its actual value
    print(a) #Printing the value of the string stored in the variable a for 'a' no.of times
print(type(a)) #We can confirm that the data type of the variable being printed is a string with the help of type() function
