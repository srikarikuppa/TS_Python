#Write a program that:
#Accepts a list of integers from the user
#Adds an element to the list
#Removes an element from the list
#Modifies an element at a specified index
#Performs an addition operation on two elements at user-specified indices and prints the sum

#User input containing a list of integers
l = list(map(int,input("Enter a list of integers seperated by space: ").split()))

#The list initially before any operations performed on it
print("The list of integers as given by user: ", l)

#Addition of a new element
a = int(input("Enter an element to be added: "))
l.append(a)
print("The list after adding the specified element: ",l)

#Removing an element
b = int(input("Enter an element to be removed: "))
l.remove(b)
print("The list after removing the specified element: ",l)

#Modifying an element
i = int(input("Enter an index to be modified: "))
c = int(input("Enter a new value: "))
l[i] = c
print("The list after modifying the value at the specified index: ",l)

#Addition of two user-specified elements from the list
print("Addition is going to be performed on two elements that you specify from the list: ")
x = int(input("Enter the index of the first number: "))
y = int(input("Enter the index of the second number: "))
s = l[x] + l[y]
print("The sum of the two numbers is: ",s)

#Printing the final list
print("The final list is: ",l)
